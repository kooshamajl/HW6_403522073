\section{Git and GitHub}
\subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
First, we go to the GitHub website, click on the "New" option to create a new repository, and then use the terminal to clone it with the git clone command.

\subsection{GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}
First, we create the main.yml file and commit it to GitHub.


\section{Exploration Tasks}
\subsection{Vim Advanced Features}
Explore and document 3 advanced features of Vim that were not covered in class.

\subsection{Memory profiling}
This semester, you got to know about dynamic memory allocation in C in your Programming Fundamentals class.

\subsubsection{Memory Leak}
In short, explain what memory leaks are and how they might happen in your program.

\subsubsection{Memory profilers}
Read about a tool called \textit{Valgrind} and write about their purpose and how it helps when memory leaks happen.

\subsection{GNU/Linux Bash Scripting}
In this section, you will get to know some handy bash utilities.

\subsubsection{fzf}
Read about a handy CLI tool called \textit{fzf} and answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is fuzzy searching? Give a short description.
    \item Install fzf on your machine and give a description of what the following command does:\\
        \texttt{ls | fzf}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Using fzf to find your favorite PDF}
You might have came across moments when you want to open up a certain PDF when studying for your final exams but finding the directory of that
PDF is a very gruesome and tiring process. In this section, we will be using \textit{fzf} to find our PDF in seconds! We will be going step by step
on how to find your file and use fzf to select it.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We first need to list the directory of all the files with the extension \texttt{.PDF}. Write a command to list the directory of all the files with the extension \texttt{.PDF} \\
        \textbf{HINT:} use the command \texttt{fd} for this purpose.
    \item Now we have to select the PDF we want using \textit{fzf}. Write a command to use \textit{fzf} to select a PDF from the data we gathered above.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Opening the file using Zathura}
Now that have selected which PDF we want to open, we can use a very minimalistic program called \textit{Zathura} to open it. Write a command that uses the
commands above to open the file using Zathura.
\paragraph{HINT:} This is how Zathura opens files: \texttt{zathura /path/to/file}
\paragraph{HINT:} Learn what the syntax \texttt{zathura \$(\textit{command})} does and use to open the PDF we have selected.

\section{Git and FOSS}
\subsection{README.md}
Make sure to include a basic README.md file in your GitHub repository that describes the aim of this repository and its purpose.

Make sure to use headings and lists in your README.md file.

\subsection{Issues}
Create a sample issue in the repository below and attach its screenshot in your LaTeX document:

\url{https://github.com/MiliAxe/CW-Final}

\subsection{FOSS contribution}
Do you see yourself contributing to FOSS projects in the future? If yes, what kind of projects are you interested in contributing to? If no, why not?
